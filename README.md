# multicube
A wrapper for [pyspeckit](https://github.com/pyspeckit/pyspeckit), designed for extended flexibility with fitting spectral cubes. Featuring:

* better initial guess selection
* pixel-specific guesses
* model selection *(not implemented)*
* multiple component fits

Check out this [notebook](notebooks/example.ipynb) for a demo!

You can also clone and install `multicube` locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlas-sokolov/multicube.git
